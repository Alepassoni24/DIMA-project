\chapter{General Overview}

\section{Concept}
	CookingTime is a multi-platform application that allows users to share their homemade cooking recipes with others and to search for new ones among the variety of recipes posted by other people.
	Furthermore users can save their favorite recipes in a personal recipe book in the app in order to always have them at hand and never lose them.
	Users will also be able to give suggestions by writing reviews and rate recipes of other users.
	To access these functionalities, user are required to register to the server via mail and password, Google account, Facebook account or Twitter account.
	The main components of the project are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The client side part, the application itself, which is the first point of interaction with the user.
		It allows the user to access all the functionalities of the app, the app will then automatically query the server-side database based on the user's requests.
		
		\item The server side part, fully made with the Firebase platform, contains the relational database used to store all the users data, which comprehend user's login information, recipes and reviews.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
TODO introduction to this section
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Portability}: Using a cross-platform implementation allows to use the application run both in Android and IOS systems. The application could be run on different sized devices as well.
	
	\item \textbf{Usability}: All the features of the application are quite easy to be found as the design of the interfaces are very user-friendly in order to provide the best user experience.
	
	\item \textbf{Stability}: TODO
	
	\item \textbf{Availability}: The application must be always working and be connected to the Firebase platform. In case of any kind of failure it must be restored as soon as possible.
	
	\item \textbf{Reliability}: TODO ***do we need it? or how we have to implement it? i think it's not security stuff.***
	
	\item \textbf {Security}: As the user have different way to sign in the application and they are providing some personal data, the app must be implement some security actions. For this reason the connection between the application and the Firebase server are done using and encrypted comunication through SHA-1 keys.
	
	\item \textbf{Scalability}: TODO
	
	\item \textbf{Extensibility}: The application is developed for some basic feature which can be increased over the time.
	
	\item \textbf{Maintainability}: The application was developed with a clear coding style by commentig all the part in order to let the code be readable to anyone who wants to touch it.
	
	\item \textbf{Nice User Interface}: It's important that user experience will be the best, for this reason the UI is very nice and simple.
\end{itemize}
