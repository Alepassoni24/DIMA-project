\chapter{General Overview}

\section{Concept}
CookingTime is a multi-platform application that allows users to share their homemade cooking recipes with others and to search for new ones among the variety of recipes posted by other people.
Furthermore users can save their favorite recipes in a personal recipe book in the app in order to always have them at hand and never lose them.
Users will also be able to give suggestions by writing reviews and rate recipes of other users.
To access these functionalities, user are required to register to the server via mail and password, Google account, Facebook account or Twitter account.
The main components of the project are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The client side part, the application itself, which is the first point of interaction with the user.
	It allows the user to access all the functionalities of the app, the app will then automatically query the server-side database based on the user's requests.
	\item The server side part, fully made with the Firebase platform, contains the relational database used to store all the users data, which comprehend user's login information, recipes and reviews.
\end{itemize}
