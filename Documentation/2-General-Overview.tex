\section{Concept}
	CookingTime is a multi-platform application that allows users to share their homemade cooking recipes with others and to search for new ones among the variety of recipes posted by other people.
	Furthermore users can save their favorite recipes in a personal recipe book in the app in order to always have them at hand and never lose them.
	Users will also be able to give suggestions by writing reviews and rate recipes of other users.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The client side part, the application itself, which is the first point of interaction with the user.
		It allows the user to access all the functionalities of the app, the app will then automatically query the server-side database based on the user's requests.
		
		\item The server side part, fully made with the Firebase platform, contains the relational database used to store all the users data, which comprehend user's login information, recipes and reviews.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
TODO introduction to this section
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Portability}: Using a cross-platform implementation allows the application to run both in Android and iOS systems. The application could be run on different sized devices as well.
	
	\item \textbf{Usability}: All the features of the application are quite easy to be found as the design of the interfaces are very user-friendly in order to provide the best user experience.
	
	\item \textbf{Availability and Reliability}: The application must be always working and be connected to the Firebase platform.
	The downtime is strictly related to the one of Firebase, which is very low.
	In case of any kind of failure the application must be restored to a correct state as soon as possible.
	
	\item \textbf {Security}: As the user have different way to sign in the application and they are providing some personal data, the app must be implement some security actions. For this reason the connection between the application and the Firebase server are done using and encrypted communication through SHA-1 keys.
	
	\item \textbf{Extensibility}: The application is developed for some basic feature which can be increased over the time.
	
	\item \textbf{Maintainability}: The application was developed with a clear coding style by commenting all the part in order to let the code be readable to anyone who wants to touch it.
	
	\item \textbf{Nice User Interface}: It's important that user experience will be the best, for this reason the UI is very nice and simple.
\end{itemize}
