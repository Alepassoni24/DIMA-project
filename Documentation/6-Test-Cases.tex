\chapter{Test Cases}
The testing phase of CookingTime was splitted into two steps.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Unit test:} In this step we tested some function like validators in order to see if they are behaving in the correct way.
	\item \textbf{Integration-Widget test:} This was the last task performed, in which we automated the testing of the behaviour of widgets.
\end{itemize}

Here are presented some example od the most realvant test we made:

\subsection{Unit test}
%TODO 1 table of validators test

\subsection{Integration-Widget test}
This type of testing was automated for all the feature that are repeatable over the time, all the action non reversible were tested manually
%TODO integration test tables
