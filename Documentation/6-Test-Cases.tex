\chapter{Test Cases}
The testing phase of CookingTime was split into two steps.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Unit test:} In this step we tested some function, like text validators, in order to see if they are behaving in the correct way.
	\item \textbf{Integration-Widget test:} Since all the functionalities of the application are strictly tied with Firebase, we skipped entirely the Widget testing phase and we did a deep integration testing.
	This was the last task performed, in which we automated the testing of the behaviour across multiple widgets and Firebase's services.
\end{itemize}

Here are presented some example of the most relevant test we made:

\section{Unit test}

	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Test Case}& Validator Test\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Goal}& input a valid parameter\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Input}& 
	\begin{minipage}{.7\linewidth}
	In one of the application screen,the user insert a valid parameter into a textfield.
	\end{minipage}\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Expected Outcome}& The validator doesn't output any error message.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Actual Outcome}& 
	\begin{minipage}{.7\linewidth}
	CORRECT: The validator process the input and send it to the requested routine without displaying any error message.
	\end{minipage}\\
	\hline	
	\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\section{Integration-Widget test}
This type of testing was automated for all the feature that are repeatable over the time, while all the non reversible actions were tested manually.
