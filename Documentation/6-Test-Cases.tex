\chapter{Test Cases}
The testing phase of CookingTime was split into two steps.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Unit test:} In this step we tested some function, like text validators, in order to see if they are behaving in the correct way.
	\item \textbf{Integration-Widget test:} Since all the functionalities of the application are strictly tied with Firebase, we skipped entirely the Widget testing phase and we did a deep integration testing.
	This was the last task performed, in which we automated the testing of the behaviour across multiple widgets and Firebase's services.
\end{itemize}

Here are presented some example of the most relevant test we made:

\section{Unit test}
%TODO 1 table of validators test

\section{Integration-Widget test}
This type of testing was automated for all the feature that are repeatable over the time, while all the non reversible actions were tested manually.
