\chapter{Future Works}
In this section we will present future possible improvements for CookingTime application.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Give some badges in order to make fidelization of user and to give prizes to most active and productive user.
	\item Notification system, to let the user know when another user reviewed his/her recipes. 
	\item Possibility to add ingredients required for a recipe to a shopping list. This allows people to take what they need to prepare some of the recipes.
	\item Add additional categories to group more finely different types of recipes.
	\item Allow users to search recipes by title or by ingredient, specifying a text to search for.
	\item Allow users to check the profile of other users, in order to see their statistics and other recipes they wrote.
\end{itemize}
These are the main improvements we can implement after the release of the application, but as everyone knows, this type of app, which allows user to interact and share something from their own lives, has no limit of improvement about features, user experience and layout.
