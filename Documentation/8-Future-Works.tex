\chapter{Future Works}
In this section we will present future possible improvements for CookingTime application.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Give some badges in order to make fidelization of user and to give prizes to most active and productive user.
	\item Notification system, to let the user know when another user reviewed his/her recipes. 
	\item Possibility to add ingridients required for a recipe to a shopping list. This allow people to take what they need to prepare some of the recipes.
\end{itemize}
These are the main improvements we can implement after the release of the application, but as everyone know, this type of app, which allows user to interact and share something from thier own lifes, has no limit of improvement about features, user experience and layout.
